Bonus:
------

- I've chosen to implement bonus sections 2 & 3 (3 distinct levels with increasing difficulty 
  and custom visuals): I'm very connected to the visual side of things, and I felt that
  making this game with primitive shapes will make it bland and devoid of the fun and
  'gamey' aspects. Also, despite being a prorotype, I wanted it to have a defined structure,
  which would give a clear sense of beginning, progression and an end.

- Regarding the other sections:
	- (1) As far as I know, MVC is not necessarily the predominant design pattern in Unity game dervelopment.
	  While I had experience with MVC in the past as an Android developer, I don't feel that it would
 	  have served my purpose in this project.
 	- (4) Using a custom soundtrack and SFX could have been cool, but I felt that it's less important
	  in the context of this prototype.
	- (5) While local multiplayer sounds interesting, it would have considerably broadened 
	  the project's scope. Also, this feature is feasibly only on PC. 
	  This would have made certain code sections more cumbersome and complex, since now
	  certain code sections would be required to work differently, depending on 
          the user's platform.	
	- (6) My implementation does not have a score system.
